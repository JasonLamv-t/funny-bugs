# Guichu-webcam

A funny bug, created when implementing a requirement related to webcam works wonders.

First, install dependences:

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the page.

Everything was easy to understand!
